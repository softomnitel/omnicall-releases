# Changelog

Public release history for **OmniCall** distribution builds.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).  
Versioning: SemVer. Git tag: `v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- The same installers are also published on the SoftOmniTel GitHub profile. In-app update checks continue to use HailRase/omnicall-releases.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Changing the interface language applies immediately and stays selected; the previous Settings refresh loop that could revert the language and spam theme / SDK gateway updates is fixed.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- External Applications settings: illustrated cards for open mode and after-call
  window behavior, visual previews for raise / always-on-top, and an interactive
  window size and position editor with overlay layers.
- Clear “Sign in” call-to-action on the idle dialpad when the phone is not
  registered yet, plus a first-run hint on the Account settings tab when no
  profiles are saved.

### Fixed

- OCP sign-in progress stages no longer jump backward when phone credentials
  arrive early; failures show the real reason immediately with Reconnect ready.
- Compact OCP connection banner is a one-line status chip at the viewport edge;
  Retry uses a neutral outline style and reuses the last login instead of asking
  for credentials again when recovery can continue.
- External Services settings still load collections and requests if the history
  journal is missing or corrupt.

### Changed

- SIP server and registration errors (including 403) appear as Notification Center
  toasts with a shortcut to System State; field validation stays on the Account
  form without duplicating the same error in both places.
- OCP sign-in progress shows six stages, including a wait for phone credentials
  after module authorization.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- SDK host integration hardening: single session revision coordinator, safer
  pairing/dedup isolation, fail-closed Origin checks, and cancel-safe activation.

### Changed

- Companion browser SDK `@softomnitel/omnicall-kit` **0.2.0** (discovery helper,
  package-owned SDK version, typed waitUntil timeout/cancel).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Notification Center in Settings → Notifications: control which modules show in-app
  popups, appearance (position, stacking, duration, close button), and review history.
  Optional “raise window on errors” per module (off by default). Preferences export/import
  includes these settings; notification history is not exported.
- Selectable incoming ringtone in Settings → Sessions, with preview.
- External Applications in Settings → Integrations: open URLs or apps on call events,
  with optional page-controlled close confirmation.
- Pin softphone always on top from the window controls (remembered in settings).
- Automatic **Post-call processing** trigger for External Services / Applications when
  the OCP operator enters post-call processing.

### Fixed

- Disabling in-app popups still hides them if notification history cannot be saved to disk.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- External Services: outbound HTTP automations in Settings → Integrations (collections, requests, Run now, history journal, template variables)
- Optional delay before each automatic trigger (0–180 seconds) with a Queue monitor and logout warning for waiting jobs
- Settings Integrations always shows OCP Module and External Services together; OmniCall Kit stays a separate top-level item
- Settings window can fill the work area without using the OS maximize button

### Fixed

- OCP reconnect banner no longer disappears during brief recovery reconnect flaps

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Release install step builds OmniCall Protocol correctly (`tsc -b --force`) so CI can publish installers

### Notes

- First published 1.x installers after failed `v1.1.0` / `v1.1.1` CI runs; includes OmniCall rebrand, shared-desk SDK call control, and toast viewport fixes from 1.1.0

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Release pipeline builds the OmniCall Protocol package before tests so installer publish can complete (first published 1.x installers after the failed `v1.1.0` CI run)

### Notes

- Includes all user-facing changes from 1.1.0 / 1.0.0 (OmniCall rebrand, shared-desk SDK call control, toast viewport fixes)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Shared-desk OmniCall Kit call control: paired sites with matrix grants can answer, reject, hang up, hold, mute, and originate (no transfer/conference over SDK)
- Granular call permissions in Settings → Integrations → OmniCall Kit, with umbrella call-control grant
- Operator preferences export/import (portable JSON without passwords or pairing secrets)
- Single-stage bootstrap splash with brand mark
- OCP queue name on call cards; progressive/preview campaign UI with centered preview modal
- SDK connect ceremony (Origin trust + pairing) and activate-profile consent flow
- Privileged SDK window hide with tray Show recovery while hidden

### Changed

- Product rebrand to **OmniCall** (SoftOmniTel): installers `OmniCall-*`, app id `com.softomnitel.omnicall`
- OmniCall Kit packages `@softomnitel/omnicall-kit` / `@softomnitel/omnicall-protocol`; protocol paths under `/omnicall/v1/`

### Fixed

- Toasts stay inside the window through compact ↔ Settings resize and clear frameless titlebar controls
- Corrupt SDK pairing secrets no longer crash Settings; re-pair after purge
- Auto-open DevTools on startup disabled

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **MAJOR:** product renamed to OmniCall (SoftOmniTel); previous product/SDK names retired
- App data migrates once into OmniCall storage; preferences format id `omnicall.preferences`

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- SDK Origin first-contact TOFU Allow/Deny modal
- Origin blacklist with Unblock restore rules
- Per-Origin capability matrix in Settings → Integrations → OmniCall Kit
- Activate-profile consent modal (every login when matrix allows activate)
- Pre-auth access to OmniCall Kit Settings (OCP Module remains gated)

### Changed

- SDK gateway always listens on loopback (Settings enable toggle removed; kill-switch `OMNICALL_SDK_GATEWAY=0` only)
- Machine-common Origin trust store; blacklist wins over env allow seed

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Saved-credentials overwrite dialog closes immediately after confirm (no wait for full OCP/SIP sign-in)
- Overwrite dialog Cancel stays visible in the footer
- “Overwrite and sign in” menu no longer hides under the dialog
- Disconnect OCP in the sign-in progress modal returns to full pre-login idle so Login is available again
- Account Reconnect is shown only for the profile that owns the active session

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- OCP sign-in modal Reconnect recovers the current attempt without starting a new Login
- Cancelling OCP sign-in no longer lets a stale attempt overwrite progress or start SIP register

- Rolling 24-hour notification journal with filters, search, and pagination
- One-click sign-in from a saved profile with masked SIP/OCP secrets

### Changed

- Account session, OCP authorization, and SIP readiness are independent states
- Logout is a single Application cascade: OCP → SIP → local account session
- Sign-in errors stay visible until edit or retry; overwrite and dirty-draft UX are explicit

### Fixed

- Stale OCP messages from a replaced WebSocket are ignored
- Profile and secret persistence recover from corruption; secrets stay out of events and logs

## [0.10.4] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- Cancelling the saved-profile update dialog no longer starts authorization
