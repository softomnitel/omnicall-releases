## About OmniCall

## Release Notes

Each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/HailRase/omnicall-releases/releases) includes structured notes: highlights, added features, changes, and fixes.

A full version history is also available in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Updates

OmniCall checks for updates using [`update-manifest.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HailRase/omnicall-releases/main/update-manifest.json) on the `main` branch of **HailRase/omnicall-releases**.

- **In the app:** Settings → General → About → **Check for updates**
- When a newer version is available, the app opens the latest **HailRase** release download page
- Updates are **manual** — the app does not auto-install new versions
- Identical installer files are also published to [`softomnitel/omnicall-releases`](https://github.com/softomnitel/omnicall-releases/releases) for profile visibility. In-app checks do not use that mirror.

The manifest exposes `latestVersion`, `downloadUrl`, per-platform installer URLs, and a link to release notes.
